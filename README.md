# Wurkus
An online platform which allows sponsors and event organisers to collaborate.

This is a project that I had created in my final year project from scratch. 

I have used 
HTML for structuring the webpage, 
CSS for styling, 
Javascript for adding functionality to the site, 
Php to interact with the Mysql Db, 
Ajax to reload portions of page in the background, 
MySql as a database.
Other than these I used Phpmyadmin, Git repository.
